# 🛠️ LAZY TECH 2 - PowerShell Helpdesk Toolkit

Author: Kyle Martin

Version: 2.0

Platform: Windows PowerShell (Run as Admin)

## 💡 What Is It?

LAZY TECH 2 is for every tech who's ever said:

“Why do I need to click through 5 different settings windows just to fix Outlook?”

“Why can’t there just be a menu for all the usual crap I deal with?”

“I’m not typing 10 PowerShell commands—I just want to fix it.”

This toolkit is your escape hatch from endless clicking, command memorization, and hunting through the Control Panel. It gives you a clean PowerShell menu to handle the most common and annoying Windows issues in just a few keystrokes.

You run the script, pick a number, fix the issue. Done.

## 🚀 Quick Start

If you're lazy (as intended), just clone the repo and go:

powershell

Edit
git clone https://github.com/sudocod3r/LAZY_TECH_2.git
cd LAZY_TECH_2
.\LAZY_TECH_2.ps1
✅ Don’t forget to right-click > Run with PowerShell or launch it in an elevated terminal.
